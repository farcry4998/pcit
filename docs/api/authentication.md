# Authentication

## Generated API Access Token

To authenticate against the KhsCI API, you need an API access token generated by the KhsCI command line client or website profile.

> 要想访问 API 资源，必须首先生成密钥，之后在请求头中增加相关设置即可。

### From CLI

```bash

$ khsci login -u YOUR_NAME -p YOUR_PASSWOD -e https://ci.domain.com

$ khsci token

Your access token is XXXXX
```

### From Website

Login https://ci.khs1994.com/login or https://ci.domain.com/login, Then find API access token from profile.

## Access API Via Tokens

Include the token in the Authorization header of each request to https://ci.khs1994.com/api or https://ci.domain.com/api

```bash
$ curl -H "Authorization: token xxxxxxxxxxxx" \
     https://ci.khs1994.com/api/user
```
